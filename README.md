# 🚴‍♀️ Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

This repository contains my **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project**, focused on analyzing the **Cyclistic bike-share dataset** (provided by Divvy/Motivate International Inc.) to identify differences in usage patterns between **annual members** and **casual riders**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and to recommend strategies for converting casual riders into members.

This case study follows the six-step data analysis framework:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Annual members typically take **shorter rides during weekdays**, suggesting commuter use.  
- Casual riders tend to take **longer rides on weekends**, indicating leisure-oriented behavior.  
- Targeted marketing and flexible membership plans can help convert casual users to annual members.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **R** (R Markdown)
- **tidyverse**, **dplyr**, **lubridate** for data cleaning and manipulation  
- **ggplot2** for visualization  
- Followed the **Google Data Analytics Capstone** methodology
